# aws-gaming

I'm trying to do what [this guide](https://lg.io/2015/07/05/revised-and-much-faster-run-your-own-highend-cloud-gaming-service-on-ec2.html) accomplishes, but with CloudFormation. I found [another guide](https://serverlesscode.com/post/gaming-on-a-budget-cloudformation/) that attempts this, but it's old and has some flaws, I think.
